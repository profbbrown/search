# Search Demonstration

Use this to demonstrate linear and binary search. Invoke this two ways:

* [Linear Search](https://profbbrown.github.io/index.html)

* [Binary Search](https://profbbrown.github.io/index.html?sorted=1)

Works well projected on a screen.

I use this on an iPad, too. Load the URLs into Safari, then create a home screen bookmark for it.
When launched from its home screen icon, it will run in fullscreen mode, with no address bar or
navigation buttons.
